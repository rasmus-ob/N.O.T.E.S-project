# Functions

## Explanation
In math, functions is actually pretty easy.
In practice a function is just a tool to let you figure out a value based on a input.

## How to use

You write a function like this $f(x) = x+1$ 

The first part $f(x)$ shows us that the input is x.    
The second part shows us that the output is $x+1$.

Let's say that $x=6$, then the output of the function is $7$.
