# Functions

## Explanation:
In math, functions is actually pretty easy.
In practice a function is just a tool to let you figure out a value based on a input.

## When to use:

Functions is often used with formulas, graphs and tables.

## How to use:

You write a function like this $f(x) = x+1$

A function is often named like this: $f(x)$, $g(x)$ or $y$

The first part $f(x)$ shows us that the input is x.    
The second part shows us that the output is $x+1$.

Let's say that $x=6$, then the output of the function is $7$.

### More examples:

$x = 10$

$f(x) = 2x$ $Answer: 20$

$f(x) = 3x + 4$ $Answer: 34$

$f(x) = x + 13$ $Answer: 23$
