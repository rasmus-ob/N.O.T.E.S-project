# Algebra

## Explanation:
Algebra is a part of math that helps us figure out the undefined.

You have probably seen math that has letter in it. That is algebra!

The letter are called variables.

Variables are often undefined and that is your mission to solve for the variable.

A example is $x + 13 = 20$

## When to use:
Algebra can be used both for simple and really advanced stuff.

For example, you can figure out how much something will cost or figure out a value based on what you already know.

## How to use:

### An example is:

_"You have $20. You don't know how much money your friend has, but you know that both of your money sum up to $30. How much money does your friend have?"_

**Written in algebra:**

$20 + x = 30$

To figure out how to solve this you can subtract the constant( _in this case_ $20$ ) like this:

$20 + x - 20 = 30 - 20$

**Simplified**

$x = 10$

_Now you know how to figure out how to get the variable_

### More examples:

_"Apples cost $2 per kilogram. You don't know how much kilograms you have picked, but the price is $6. How many apples have you picked?"_

**Written in algebra:**

$2x = 6$

To figure out how to solve this you have to remove the factor that is multiplied with the variable. To do this we divide every thing on the both sides of the equal sign. 

$(2x) / 2 = (6) / 2$

**Simplified**

$x = 3$
